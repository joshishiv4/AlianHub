Work through them in order like a checklist: open a task, read it, do the small exercise at the end, then set its status to Complete.\nTry it now:\n1. Click this task's name to open it.\n2. What opened is the task detail — the description here, and the fields (Assignee, Priority, dates) beside it.\n3. Change the status from To Do to Complete, and watch this row move on the list."],

Open this task and look along the toolbar — hover each icon to see what it does.\n2. Find the Activity section: it already shows when this task was created.\n3. Change any field, look at Activity again, and see the change recorded with your name on it."],

Workload shows who has how much on their plate.\nTry it:\n1. Click Board in the tabs above.\n2. Drag this card from To Do to another column and back — dragging IS changing the status.\n3.
