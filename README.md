## Quick Start (One Command)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aliansoftwareteam/AlianHub-Project-Management-System.git
cd AlianHub-Project-Management-System
npm run setup
```

That's it. **No technical knowledge required.** `npm run setup` will:

1. Install all dependencies (root, frontend, wizard) in parallel
2. Generate a `.env` file with secure random secrets
3. Build the installation wizard UI
4. Start the backend and frontend dev server
5. **Auto-complete the installation wizard** — connects to MongoDB, sets up storage, skips optional services (Firebase / AI / SMTP), initializes the database, and creates an admin account
6. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser

When it's done, you'll see this in your terminal:

```
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  ✓  AlianHub is ready!
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  URL:       http://localhost:8080
  Email:     admin@admin.local
  Password:  admin123

  API:       http://localhost:4000
  Stop:      Ctrl+C in this terminal
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

**Prerequisite:** MongoDB running locally on `mongodb://localhost:27017`. If you don't have it: `docker run -d -p 27017:27017 mongo:7` or download from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

### Available commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `npm run setup` | Full setup — install, configure, start, auto-complete wizard, open browser |
| `npm run dev` | Fast restart — skips install, just starts the services |
| `npm run setup:reset` | Wipe `node_modules` and reinstall everything |
| `npm run setup -- --manual` | Skip auto-setup — open the interactive wizard instead |
| `npm run setup -- --no-open` | Start without auto-opening a browser |

### Custom admin credentials

```bash
SETUP_ADMIN_EMAIL=you@example.com SETUP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=secret npm run setup
```

Other env-var overrides: `SETUP_ADMIN_FIRST`, `SETUP_ADMIN_LAST`, `SETUP_COMPANY`, `SETUP_PHONE`, `SETUP_COUNTRY`, `SETUP_CITY`, `SETUP_STATE`.

> **Manual setup still works.** Everything above is an additive convenience layer. All existing scripts (`npm start`, `npm run nodemon`, `npm run basic-install`, etc.) and the original interactive wizard are unchanged. If `npm run setup` ever fails it falls back automatically to the wizard UI so you can finish manually.
