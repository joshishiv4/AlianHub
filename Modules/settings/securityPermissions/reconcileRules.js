// The permission catalogue in utils/data.js is seeded once, when a company is created, and never
// revisited. So a company drifts behind the product: a permission added to the catalogue today
// never reaches a company that already exists, and the permission screen — which renders whatever
// is stored — quietly shows a different list to every customer.
//
// Measured rather than assumed, on two live companies: `task_total_estimate` is defined in the
// current catalogue and present in neither, and both carry `export_tasks` and `import_tasks`, which
// no longer exist in the product and control nothing.
//
// Re-running importCompanyRules is what repairs it, and it is safe: it reads the existing rules
// first and copies each role's saved choices back onto the defaults before writing, so an owner's
// configuration survives. Verified with a harness — an owner who had taken task deletion away from
// Member still had it taken away afterwards.
//
// It is NOT run unconditionally, because the re-seed deletes the collection before re-inserting it
// and a permission check landing in that window would fail closed. It runs only when a sentinel is
// actually absent.
//
// MAINTENANCE: when a permission key is added to the catalogue in utils/data.js, add it here too.
// That one line is what lets existing companies pick it up.

// re-inserts it, so on an installation with real traffic a permission check landing in that
// window fails closed for everyone, and a re-insert that dies halfway leaves nobody with any
// permissions at all. That is a fine trade on a fresh install and a bad one on a live company
// with a hundred people in it, so the operator decides, not us.
