// exactly how they act. No importance ranking, no snoozing, no clearing, no grouping —
// none of that exists in the sidebars today, and adding it here would make the Inbox a
// different feature rather than a replacement for them.
//
// It owns NO data of its own. The only write is mark-read, in the same shape
// app-notification/controller.js already uses, so the bell's unread count cannot drift.

// One tab per thing a user already has, plus All to see them together.
//
//   all           — both sources, unread
//   notifications — what the bell shows  (its `filter=unread` list)

//   archive       — what the bell's "View Archive" toggle shows (already read)

 *      can only ever render as a broken image. They are 10px priority icons, so every
 *      <img> is dropped rather than shown broken.
 *   2. Any tag could carry a script or an event handler, and this is rendered with
 *      v-html. Only inline emphasis survives; everything else is unwrapped to its text.
 *
 * Display-only. The source rows are never modified.
